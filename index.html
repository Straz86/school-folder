  My notes from week one of <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity's'</a> "Intro to Programming" course <br><BR>
<B>UNIT 1-</B></BR>
  <B><EM>THE WEB<br>
A)HTML<BR>
B)URLS<BR>
C)HTTP<BR>
D)WEB APPLICATIONS<BR></EM></B>
<BR><b>WORLD WIDE WEB</b><br>
	<em>HTML</em>=HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE<br>
	 ITS BASICALLY 
        THE MAIN TYPE OF DOCUMENT ON THE WEB<br><br>

<b>MAJOR PIECES OF THE WEB</b> <br>
<EM>-ME</EM>=PC AND BROWSER, BROWSER READS OR DECODES LANGUAGE<br>
  <EM>-INTERNET</EM>=LINK OR ROAD TO GET INFORMATION<br>
  <EM>-SERVERS</EM>=BASICALLY PC WITH LOTS OF FILES AND SPACE<BR></BR>
<B>HTML</B>-HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE<BR>
	WHICH IS MADE UP OF<BR>
<EM>-TEXT CONTENT</EM>-WHAT YOU SEE <BR>
<EM>-MARKUP</EM>-WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE<BR>
 <EM>-REFERENCES</EM> -TO OTHER DOCS-IMAGES,VIDEOS, MUSIC AND LINKS TO OTHER PAGES<BR>

<P>IN HTML PLAIN TEXT SHOWS UP AS PLAIN TEXT FOR THE MOST PART,
MARKUP CHANGES THE WAY IT LOOKS.  HTML MARKUP BASICALLY=TAGS, 
THE BASIC LOOK OF A TAG WOULD BE:

<B>< NAME>  CONTENTS < /NAME>,</B> 
	WHERE	<B>< NAME> </B> IS HOW YOU START OR OPEN THE TAG, THIS <B> < /NAME></B> 
  WOULD BE HOW TO CLOSE THE TAG.
	TOGHETHER THE OPENING AND CONTENT THEN CLOSING IS CALLED THE <B><EM>ELEMENT.</EM></B></P>

TAGS EXAMPLES<br>B TAG= <B>BOLD CONTENT </B>,
	EM TAG=<EM>EMPHASIS OR ITALICS CONTENT</EM>. <BR>
		1. if tags are not closed i.e no < /em>, everything post the 
		opening tag will stay as is, either bold or in italics. 

<p><B>2) HTML ATTRIBUTES</B><BR>
 A STRING WOULD LIKE SOMETHING LIKE THIS, < TAG ATTRIBUTE="VALUE"> CONTENTS < /TAG>
	<BR>TAGS CAN HAVE MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES. 
ANCHOR TAGS LOOK LIKE THIS < A> TO OPEN AND < /A> TO CLOSE. <BR>
	HREF= ATTRIBUTE NAME ANCHORS CAN OR GENERALLY LEAD TO  LINKS,IMAGES, MUSIC, ETC.<BR>
IMAGE TAG=<IMG>
STRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE= <IMG SCR="URL" ALT= "TEXT">  THE END PORTION,
SRC=SOURCE IE THE WEBPAGE OR PHOTO LINK
ALT="TEXT"> IS A VOID TAG IT HAS NO CONTENT IT WOULD BE USED IN CASE OF
A BROKEN LINK.

EXAMPLE = <IMG SCR="HTTP://UDACITY.COM/CS253X/HIPMUNK.PNG" ALT="HIPMUNK!"> </p>

<B>3.) WHITESPACE </B> <BR>
	WHITESPACE IS TEXT ON MULTIPLE LINES, THERE IS NO NATURAL SPACE OR RETURN, ALL TEXT WILL STAY ON THE  SAME LINE, TO AVOID YOU 
	NEED A BREAK TAG < BR>
  OR YOU CAN ALSO USE A  < P> TAG =PARAGRAPH.   < P> TAG IS AN INVISIBLE BOX BASICALLY CROPS WHAT IS IN THE BOX WITH HEIGHT AND WIDTH.
  <BR>B.)INLINE/BLOCK
	< BR> TAB IS INLINE OR ENDING A LINE

	< SPAN> IS IN LINE
	< DIV> IS BLOCK<BR>

	 (a, span, br, img, and strong are all inline elements,
	 while div, p, and form are block elements.)
  <P><B>4)HTML DOCUMENTS</B> <BR>

  1) <!DOCTYPE HTML> =THE DOCTYPES  USED TO BE MANY, IT  IS NOW PRIMARILY HTML5<BR>
	2)< HEAD>= HEADING OF DOCUMENT WOULD OR COULD INCLUDE META-DATA OR JAVA OR CSS <BR>
